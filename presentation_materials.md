## 1. 2-Minute Demo Walkthrough Script

**Goal:** Showcase the premium aesthetic, real-time features, and community-driven mission of SENTINEX.

| Time | Segment | Visuals/Actions | Narration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0:00-0:20** | **Intro & Hero** | Landing on Home Page; 3D Cyber Globe rotating in background; Neon text flickering. | "Welcome to SENTINEX, the first-of-its-kind digital headquarters designed for our AI and Cybersecurity student community. Beyond a simple website, it's a mission-control hub where students can track their growth, find teammates, and compete in global rankings." |
| **0:20-0:45** | **Core UX & Events** | Scrolling to the 'Event Ticker' and 'Features' section. | "The UI uses a dark glassmorphic aesthetic with neon accents to reflect the hacker culture. Our real-time event ticker pulls live data on upcoming CTFs and workshops, ensuring no member misses an opportunity to earn points and level up." |
| **0:45-1:15** | **Leaderboard & Firestore** | Switching to the 'Leaderboard' page; showing the Top 3 Podium and Tab switching. | "The competitive heartbeat of the platform is our Leaderboard. Powered by Firebase Firestore, it provides real-time ranking updates. Students don't just see a list; they see a podium of champions, current point distributions, and achievement badges that prove their mastery in specific domains." |
| **1:15-1:40** | **AI Threat Analyzer** | Opening the 'Threat Analyzer' module on the home page; pasting sample code. | "We've also integrated interactive modules like our AI-powered Threat Analyzer. This gives students a sandbox to test suspicious code patterns and receive instant heuristic feedback—bridging the gap between learning and practical defense." |
| **1:40-2:00** | **Closing** | Navigating back to the Signup CTA; showing the footer. | "Built with Next.js, Three.js, and Firebase, SENTINEX is more than a tool—it's the home for the next generation of cyber defenders. Thank you, and we look forward to seeing you inside the grid." |
